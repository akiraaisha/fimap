This is fimap alpha .08 - Enemy Unknown

New in this version:
  * Complete new engine which uses XML files inside the config folder.
  * Added a tiny but powerful exploit-mode plugin interface.
  * Can scan and exploit windows servers!
  * Can scan and attack more than just PHP. Just create your own XML file for new languages!
  * Can use POST variables to scan and attack.
  * Shell user will now be displayed in the fimap shell.
  * Lots of small improvments. For example you can skip now single scans\attacks with CTRL+C when they are frozen for some reason.
  * Has a colorful-mode (-C) which makes it easier to read out infos quickly (Unix only)
  * You can install trusted plugins now thru fimap (-I).
  * You can update your definition XML files thru fimap (--update-def)
  * And as usual much more which isn't worth to mention.

This version is still heavily for PHP only. But the system is ready to pwn them all.
